Madama Jiu-Jitsu Academy opened it&#8217;s doors five years ago this month. Many seasoned blue belts have been promoted to purple belt. Other long-time white belts got their promotions to blue. This week Professor Madama added a couple more colors &#8212; yellow and green.</p>\n<div class=\"note_box\">Brazilian Jiu-jitsu has several belt colors for kids 16-years-old and under that aren&#8217;t part of the adult graduation system of white, blue, purple, brown, and black belts. These belts are yellow, orange, and green.</div>\n<p>Before presenting these belts, Professor Madama spoke of how proud he is to train with our young teammates. &#8220;It takes a lot of guts for a 14, 15, or 16-year-old to step on the mat with grown men. Not a lot of people can do it. I respect you for it and am proud to call you my teammates and training partners,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>In the Beginner&#8217;s Class, the following students were promoted:</p>\n</p>\n<ul class=\"arrow_list\">\n<li>Kevin Taisma, Yellow Belt (recently graduated from our Kids Class);</li>\n<li>Dominik Vitale, Yellow Belt (recently graduated from our Kids Class);</li>\n<li>Cody Tchir, Green Belt (recently graduated from our Kids Class);</li>\n<li>Jake Westlund, Green Belt;</li>\n<li>Vinny Antonozzi, Green Belt and;</li>\n<li>Johnny &#8220;Weird Science&#8221; Burnett, Green Belt.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<p>There were also two belt promotions in our Kids Class:</p>\n</p>\n<ul class=\"arrow_list\">\n<li>Max Madama, Yellow Belt and;</li>\n<li>B&#8217;rynn McCormick, Yellow Belt.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<p>Again, we are proud of our young teammates and offer them hearty congratulations on all their hard work, loyalty, and dedication.</p>\n","commentRss":"http://madamajj.com/2010/10/08/the-kids-get-colors/feed/"},{"title":"Silver at the Pan-Ams","link":"http://madamajj.com/2010/10/07/silver-at-the-pan-ams/","comments":["http://madamajj.com/2010/10/07/silver-at-the-pan-ams/#comments","0"],"pubDate":"Thu, 07 Oct 2010 13:40:10 +0000","creator":"jimformation","category":["Academy News","News"],"guid":{"isPermaLink":"false","content":"http://madamajj.com/?p=380"},"description":"<p>Congratulations to Mike &#8220;Shammy&#8221; Elshamy for his second place finish at last weekend&#8217;s International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation Pan-American No-Gi Championships.
